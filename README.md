# liri-bot
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

There is no need to provide parameters when starting this node application.  Inquirer package handles all user inputs and navigation.  This will ensure the user does not get lost when navigating through the application. Just run the liri.js file.
